      <h1>TIME Terms of Use</h1>
      <h3>MOBILE APPS/WEBSITE, TIME TERMS OF USE</h3>
      <p>For TIME Subscription Terms, see Section 6 below.</p>
      <h3>Welcome to TIME!</h3>
      <p>FIRST, AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE ("Terms", "Terms of Use", or
        "Agreement") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS PLATFORM, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WAIVERS OF RIGHTS, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND YOUR INDEMNITY TO US. <b>THIS AGREEMENT
          REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN COURTS OR JURY TRIALS,
          AND LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.</b></p>
      <p>These Terms of Use describe the terms and conditions that govern your use of the current and future online and
        mobile websites, platforms, services, applications, and networks owned or operated by "TIME", including without
        limitation, TIME.com and/or for which TIME currently or in the future provides services and/or technology (the
        "Platform" or "Platforms"). You accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use when you use any of the
        Platforms, without limitation, when you view or access content or videos on any of the Platforms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>1. Use of the Platform:</h3>
      <p>(A) The content and features on the Platform are intended for users who are at least 18 years old. If you are
        under the age of 18, you should obtain the permission of a parent or legal guardian. Certain parts of the
        Platform may be subject to other eligibility requirements.</p>
      <p>(B) Governing Terms. These Terms of Use, along with any additional terms and conditions that are referenced
        herein or that are presented elsewhere on the Platform in relation to a specific service or feature and the <a
          href="#">TIME Privacy Policy</a>, set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Platform.
        By using the Platform, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions hereof. If you do not agree to
        these Terms of Use, you should not access or use the Platform.</p>
      <p>(C) Changes to Terms of Use. TIME may modify the Terms of Use, or any part thereof, or add or remove terms at
        any time, and such modifications, additions or deletions will be effective immediately upon posting. Your use of
        the Platform after such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such modifications, additions
        or deletions.</p>
      <p>(D) Changes to Platform. At various times, TIME may choose to make available updates, bug fixes, or other
        changes or enhancements to the Platform (collectively, "Service Updates"). Service Updates may be: (i)
        Automatic, such as in connection with general website changes and additional features or updates to data
        required by the Platform, (ii) at your election, in which instance you will receive information and instructions
        for how to authorize optional Service Updates; or (iii) mandatory, in which case you will be required to consent
        to the Service Update or install or upgrade a third-party plug-in if you wish to maintain access to the
        Platform. Please note that the Platform may be unavailable during a Service Update.</p>
      <p>If you access the Platform through a mobile device, such changes may also be communicated through updated
        versions of the Platform software, which you consent to receive without further notice. Please review the Terms
        and our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. The date that these Terms were last modified can be found
        at the end of these Terms. Any modifications to these Terms, including, but not limited to, any modifications to
        the warranty disclaimers or limitation of liability contained in these Terms, will supersede the prior
        provisions for all activity occurring after the revised version has been made available.</p>
      <p>If any change materially limits the availability of the Platform, then in addition to posting the revised
        document on the Platform, we intend to communicate such a limit directly to you via the email address associated
        with Your Account. Therefore, it is important that you keep Your Account contact information up to date. Your
        continued use of the Platform after the changes come into effect and, in the case of any Subscription, your
        failure to cancel the same before it renews or within any relevant notice period, will mean you unconditionally
        accept and agree to be bound to the changes.</p>
      <p>(E) Registration. You may be given the opportunity to register via an online registration form to create a user
        account ("Your Account") that may allow you to receive information from TIME and/or to participate in certain
        features on the Platform such as certain Interactive Areas. TIME will use the information you provide in
        accordance with the <a href="#">TIME Privacy Policy</a>. By registering you represent and warrant that all
        information that you provide on the registration form is current, complete and accurate to the best of your
        knowledge. You agree to maintain and promptly update your registration information on the Platform so that it
        remains current, complete and accurate. During the registration process, you may be required to choose a
        password and/or user name. You acknowledge and agree that TIME may rely on this password or user name to
        identify you. You shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your user name(s) or password(s),
        if any. You are responsible for all use of Your Account, regardless of whether you authorized such access or
        use, and for ensuring that all use of Your Account complies fully with the provisions of these Terms of Use.</p>
      <p>(F) Consent to Electronic Communications. By registering an account with the Platform or otherwise using the
        Platform you agree that TIME and our Subscription Providers may send you emails or other electronic
        communications regarding Your Account. You also consent to receiving promotional messages, offers, surveys, and
        other materials electronically. For more information about how we communicate with you, please review our
        Privacy Policy at <a href="#">TIME Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      <p>If at any time you no longer want to receive non-transactional communications, you may unsubscribe using the
        link at the bottom of the electronic communication or you may sign into the Platform and update your
        "Newsletters" preferences in the "Settings" tab. Please note that changes made to your Notifications settings
        may not take effect immediately, and there could be a delay before your new settings become effective.</p>
      <p>(G) Equipment. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all connectivity, computer software, hardware
        and other equipment needed for access to and use of the Platform and all charges related to the same.</p>

        including Interview Club:</p>
      <p>(A) Interactive Areas. The Platform may contain comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive
        features, including User Interview Club ("Interactive Areas") in which you may post or upload user-generated
        content, including but not limited to comments, video, photos, messages, other materials or items (collectively,
        "User Content"). You are solely responsible for your use of any Interactive Areas and you use them at your own
        risk. Interactive Areas are available for individuals aged 13 years or older. By submitting User Content to an
        Interactive Area, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older and, if you are under the age of 18, you
        either are an emancipated minor, or have obtained the legal consent of your parent or legal guardian to enter
        into these Terms of Use, submit content, participate on the Platform, and fulfill the obligations set forth in
        these Terms of Use, which forms a binding contract between you and TIME. Employees of TIME may not submit User
        Content without permission from their supervisors.</p>
      <p>(B) Community Guidelines. By submitting any User Content or participating in an Interactive Area within or in

        trade secret, right of publicity or other proprietary right rests with you. You shall be solely liable for any
        damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of publicity or other
        proprietary rights or any other harm resulting from such a submission. Any person determined by TIME, in its
        sole discretion, to have violated the intellectual property or other rights of others shall be barred from

        liability.</p>

        entitled to compensation by TIME.</p>
      <p>* You agree not to impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, TIME or any TIME employee,
        or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</p>
      <p>* You agree not to represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, TIME's endorsement of User Content.</p>
      <p>* You agree not to interfere with any other user's right to privacy, including by harvesting or collecting
        personally-identifiable information about the Platform users or posting private information about a third party.

      <p>* You agree not to upload, post or otherwise transmit any User Content, software or other materials which
        contain a virus or other harmful or disruptive component.</p>

        your User Content receives. This includes pay-per-click services, web "robots" and any other current or future
        technologies. You also agree not to direct any third party to use these services, technologies or automated
        systems on your behalf.</p>
      <p>* You agree not to use any technology, service or automated system to post more User Content than an individual
        could upload in a given period of time. You also agree not to direct any third party to use these services,
        technologies or automated systems on your behalf.</p>
      <p>Any conduct that in TIME's sole discretion restricts or inhibits anyone else from using or enjoying the
        Platform will not be permitted. TIME reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove or edit User Content by
        you and to terminate Your Account for any reason.</p>
      <p>TIME does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any User Content, and does not take any responsibility
        or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading User Content posted on the Platform.
        Through your use of Interactive Areas, you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, objectionable,
        harmful, inaccurate or deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under
        false pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals. By using Interactive Areas, you assume all
        associated risks.</p>
      <p>(C) Monitoring. TIME shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor User Content posted or uploaded
        to the Platform to determine compliance with these Terms of Use and any operating rules established by TIME and
        to satisfy any law, regulation or authorized government request. Although TIME has no obligation to monitor,
        screen, edit or remove any of the User Content posted or uploaded to the Platform, TIME reserves the right, and
        has absolute discretion, to screen, edit, refuse to post or remove without notice any User Content posted or
        uploaded to the Platform at any time and for any reason, and you are solely responsible for creating backup
        copies of and replacing any User Content posted to the Platform at your sole cost and expense. In addition, TIME
        may share personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we
        believe it is necessary, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. See <a href="#">TIME Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The decision by TIME to monitor and/or modify User Content does not constitute nor shall it be deemed to
        constitute any responsibility or liability in any manner on the part of TIME in connection with or arising from
        use by you of Interactive Areas on the Platform.</p>
      <p>(D) License to User Content. By submitting User Content to the Platform, you automatically grant TIME and its
        parent company. and Warner Media, LLC, the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and
        license, but not the obligation, to use, publish, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, translate, create derivative
        works from, incorporate into other works, distribute, sub-license and otherwise exploit such User Content (in
        whole or in part) worldwide in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term
        of any copyright that may exist in such User Content, without payment to you or to any third parties. You
        represent and warrant to TIME that you have the full legal right, power and authority to grant to TIME the
        license provided for herein, that you own or control the complete exhibition and other rights to the User
        Content you submitted for the purposes contemplated in this license and that neither the User Content nor the
        exercise of the rights granted herein shall violate these Terms of Use, or infringe upon any rights, including
        the right of privacy or right of publicity, constitute a libel or slander against, or violate any common law or
        any other right of, or cause injury to, any person or entity. You further grant TIME the right, but not the
        obligation, to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or TIME's rights in the User Content by a
        breach of these Terms of Use.</p>
      <p>(E) Moral Rights. If it is determined that you retain moral rights (including rights of attribution or
        integrity) in the User Content, you hereby declare that (a) you do not require that any personally identifying
        information be used in connection with the User Content, or any derivative works of or upgrades or updates
        thereto; (b) you have no objection to the publication, use, modification, deletion and exploitation of the User
        Content by TIME or its licensees, successors and assigns; (c) you forever waive and agree not to claim or assert
        any entitlement to any and all moral rights of an author in any of the User Content; and (d) you forever release
        TIME, and its licensees, successors and assigns, from any claims that you could otherwise assert against TIME by
        virtue of any such moral rights. You also permit any other user to access, view, store or reproduce the User
        Content for that user's personal use.</p>
      <p>(F) No Obligation. User Content submitted by you will be considered non-confidential and TIME is under no
        obligation to treat such User Content as proprietary information except pursuant to the <a href="#">TIME Privacy
          Policy</a>. Without limiting the foregoing, TIME reserves the right to use any User Content as it deems
        appropriate, including, without limitation, deleting, editing, modifying, rejecting, or refusing to post it.
        TIME is under no obligation to edit, delete or otherwise modify User Content once it has been submitted to TIME.
        TIME shall have no duty to attribute authorship of User Content to you and shall not be obligated to enforce any
        form of attribution by third parties.</p>

        opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by
        third parties, including information providers or users of the Platform, are those of the respective author(s)

        specific information, opinion, advice or other content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>5. License.</h3>

        non-transferable license to access the Platform and view Content through the Platform for personal,
        non-commercial purposes on compatible devices and where applicable, while your Subscription remains active and
        in good standing. To access the Platform, you will need to use a computer, mobile device, streaming media
        player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements that we establish from time to

        reasonably foreseeable by TIME.</p>
      <p>The periods during which you can view each piece of Content may vary based on the rights available for such
        Content and the terms of your Subscription. Any unauthorized copy of any element of the Platform, including the
        Content, underlying software, or any portion thereof will constitute a violation of copyright. TIME may, in its

        you will not create another TIME Account or otherwise try to access the Platform without our permission.
        Violation of these Terms in any manner automatically terminates the license granted to you herein and obligates
        you to cease all use of the Platform.</p>

        regardless of the number of devices on which the Platform is available. TIME may change the maximum number of

      <p>(C) How Your Subscription Works. When you subscribe to the TIME Service, you are participating in a program
        through which the payment method associated with your Account and designated by you will be charged on a
        recurring basis at regular intervals selected by you. The amount you will be charged (plus applicable taxes),
        when those charges will occur, and the duration of your access to the TIME Service, are selected by you when you
        subscribe and are also explained in the confirmation email sent to you upon starting your subscription. Remember
        that you will be charged the selected amount (the "Subscription Fee") on a regular basis, at the intervals you
        select (which will be designated monthly or annually), unless and until you cancel.</p>
      <p>By purchasing a subscription, you expressly acknowledge and agree that (1) we (or our third-party payment
        processor) or the third-party Subscription Provider through which you purchased your subscription, are
        authorized to charge you on a recurring basis for your subscription (in addition to any applicable taxes) for as
        long as your subscription continues, (2) the amount you are charged, the frequency of the charges, and the
        duration of your access to the TIME Service may vary depending on the selections you make, and (3) your
        subscription is continuous until you cancel it. See below for details on canceling your subscription.</p>
      <p>(D) No Refunds. All fees are non-refundable. Refunds will not be provided for any subscription. We do not
        provide credit, refunds, or prorated billing for subscriptions that are cancelled. Even if you cancel your
        subscription to the TIME Service before the end of your active subscription period, as applicable, you will not
        receive a refund for any portion of the Subscription Fees for the remainder of that subscription period. If you
        cancel, you will continue to have access to the TIME Service until the end of the then-current Subscription
        period. Each Subscription Provider reserves the right to offer refunds, discounts or other consideration in
        select circumstances at its sole discretion. Please note that each circumstance is unique and election to make
        such an offer in one instance does not create the obligation to do so in another.</p>
      <p>(E) Price Adjustments. We reserve the right to adjust prices in our sole discretion at any time; provided,
        however, that we will provide you with at least 30 days' advance notice of any price changes with respect to the
        subscription you've chosen. Your continuation of your subscription to the TIME Service after such notice has
        been delivered to you will constitute your acceptance of such price changes, unless you cancel your Subscription
        in accordance with these Subscription Terms</p>
      <p>If you subscribed using the introductory "50% Off for Life" offer, any adjustment to the standard monthly
        Subscription Fee will result in a corresponding adjustment to your 50% off rate.</p>
      <p>(F) Cancelling Your Subscription. If you purchased your subscription on TIME.com, you may cancel your
        subscription at any time through your <a href="#">TIME.com/account/settings</a> by clicking "manage
        subscription". For subscriptions purchased through TIME.com, you must cancel at least one day before your
        subscription renewal date to avoid being charged for the next billing period. NOTE: if you obtained your
        subscription to the TIME Service through a third-party Subscription Provider you must follow the instructions
        for cancellation provided by your Subscription Provider; TIME is not responsible for third party Subscription
        Providers. If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of your current
        subscription period. You will have continued access to the TIME Service for the remainder of your paid
        subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID. You acknowledge and agree that, to the
        extent not prohibited by applicable law, cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any
        dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to the TIME Service, its content or features, including Subscription
        Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the selection of content available to you through the TIME Service;
        the Subscription Terms or any changes thereto; or any other policies or practices that apply to the TIME
        Service.</p>
      <p>(G) Changing Your Subscription Information. How you change your Subscription information varies depending on
        who bills you for your Subscription.</p>
      <p>(1) Changing Your Information. Should you wish to change your name or display name associated with your
        Subscription, you may do so within your Settings when logged into your Account.</p>
      <p>(2) Changing your Subscription Frequency. If you have purchased a Subscription and would like to make change to
        a different billing frequency, you will need to log into your Account. If you subscribed through TIME.com, you
        can change your subscription frequency by clicking "Manage" in the "Subscriptions" section of your Settings. If
        you obtained your Subscription to the TIME Service through a third-party Subscription Provider you must follow
        the instructions for changing your subscription frequency provided by your Subscription Provider.</p>
      <p>(3) Updating Your Payment Method. You may update your Payment Method with your Subscription Provider at any
        time by accessing your account with such Subscription Provider. If you subscribed through TIME.com, you can
        update your Payment Method by clicking "Edit" in the "Subscriptions" section of your Settings.</p>
      <p>(H) Unpaid Amounts. If your Payment Method is declined due to insufficient funds, expired or invalid account
        details, or otherwise, and we are unable to process your payment for your current subscription period, (1) you
        will remain responsible for all such amounts, as well as any costs that we incur in collecting any amounts you
        fail to pay for access to the TIME Service, including attorney and collection fees; (2) you authorize TIME to
        continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described in the
        TIME Account Information section; and (3) TIME may suspend or terminate your subscription until such time as
        your Payment Method has been updated and the Subscription Fee is duly paid.</p>
      <p>(I) Free Trials and Promotional Offers. In the event of a new/subsequent discount or promotional offering after
        you sign-up for the TIME Service, no refunds, adjustments or price protection will be applied to your
        Subscription Fee. Customers may take advantage of any "new customer" promotion only once. Requirements for a
        special promotion will be stated at the time each offer is presented. You agree not to register multiple times
        for the same promotional offer using multiple names, addresses, email addresses or other means. Any such action
        shall constitute a violation of these Terms and may result in the termination of your TIME Account.</p>
      <p>(1) Promotional Periods. We may provide promotional offers that include access to the TIME Service without
        charge or at a reduced cost for a limited period of time ("Promotional Periods") to new users and certain former
        subscribers at its sole discretion, but it is under no obligation to do so and Promotional Periods may not be
        available at all times or with all Subscription Providers. If we provide you with a Promotional Offer, you must
        provide valid Payment Method information to TIME in order to use TIME during the Promotional Period. TIME may
        place a temporary charge in a nominal amount on your Payment Method to ensure the validity of the Payment
        Method, but the temporary charge will be removed promptly. If you do not cancel TIME by the last day of your
        Promotional Period, you authorize TIME to begin your paid subscription and automatically charge your Payment
        Method for your first paying monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, at the end of your
        Promotional Period. If your promotional period is 7 days or less, we will notify you of the date the promotional
        period ends in the acknowledgment email notice you receive after sign up. If you wish to avoid charges to your
        payment method, you must cancel before the promotional period ends.</p>
      <p>(2) Eligibility. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for any
        Promotional Offers. The specific terms of each specific Promotional Offer will be stated in the materials
        advertising or describing the particular Promotional Offer.</p>

      <h3>7. Third Party Subscription Provider Terms.</h3>
      <p>These Terms constitute agreement between you and TIME, and not between you and any Subscription Provider(s).
        Unless otherwise specified herein, Subscription Providers will have no obligation to provide maintenance and
        support services, or respond to product claims regarding the Platform. Subscription Providers shall not be
        responsible for any product or intellectual property claims associated with the Platform. Please review the
        terms of use and user agreements of your Subscription Provider to confirm your compliance to those terms.</p>
      <p>iOS Subscribers</p>
      <p>Accessing the Platform via iOS products must be in accordance with the App Store Terms of Use in addition to
        the Terms set forth herein. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, Inc., ("Apple") and any subsidiaries of Apple,

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>8. Parental Control/Consent.</h3>
      <p>THE PLATFORM CONTAINS CONTENT THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGES OR VIEWERS. MOST ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT
        IS RATED ACCORDING TO GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA OR TELEVISION PARENTAL
        GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH HOW PARTICULAR CONTENT IS RATED AND SOME CONTENT MAY NOT BE RATED
        AND/OR MAY CONTAIN STRONG OR PROFANE LANGUAGE, VIOLENCE, ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, DRUG OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE, NUDITY,
        SEXUAL CONTENT, MATURE THEMES AND/OR MATURE CONTENT INTENDED ONLY FOR ADULTS OR THOSE UNDER SUPERVISION OF
        ADULTS. Content tends to elicit varying reactions among different people. As is true for many websites and
        content platforms, you may come across Content that you find offensive, indecent, explicit or objectionable. You
        acknowledge and voluntarily accept these risks. Also, Content types, genres, categories, and descriptions are
        provided as suggestions to help with navigation, and TIME does not guarantee that you will agree with them.</p>
      <p>If you wish to restrict Content for a Kid's Profile, you may take advantage of the Parental Controls feature of
        the Platform, by accessing the "Parental Controls" functionality within the "Manage Profiles" section of your
        TIME Account on the Platform. This will enable you to establish and manage Parental Control settings for each
        Kid's Profile linked to your TIME Account. Parental Controls allow you to set a maximum movie rating and
        television rating for each Kid's Profile, and are designed to filter out non-rated Content. Please note that
        changes made to Parental Controls may not take effect immediately, and during some periods there could be a
        delay before your new settings become effective.</p>
      <p>We do not guarantee that any movie or television rating for Content is accurate. You acknowledge that the
        Parental Controls may not always be effective in restricting all Content that you or any Authorized User may
        consider objectionable, including if you disagree with the Content rating, if changes made to Parental Controls
        are delayed or do not take effective immediately, if an Authorized User of a Kid's Profile is allowed to access
        or view Content from another Authorized User with no or different Parental Control settings, or if he or she has
        access to the PIN to change the Parental Control settings.</p>
      <p>If you choose to access or view, or allow an Authorized User to access or view, any adult or mature Content on
        the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that exposure to visual images and sounds that may depict nudity, sexual
        activity, violence, adult language, alcohol, tobacco, drug, or substance use, or are otherwise graphic in
        nature, may occur. You agree that use of the Platform by you and all Authorized Users is at your sole risk, that
        you are solely responsible for monitoring and supervising all use of your TIME Account, including those of each
        Authorized User, and that TIME and/or your Subscription Provider shall have no liability to you, any Authorized
        User or any third party for any Content viewed or accessed on your TIME Account.</p>

        under these Terms to any person or entity without TIME's prior written consent which may be withheld in TIME's
        sole discretion (and any such purported assignment, pledge or transfer without such prior written consent shall
        be
        void ab initio). In addition, the Content files or other elements of the Platform may not be used to construct
        any

      <p>TIME respects the intellectual property rights of others and asks users of the Platform to do the same. TIME
        and
        its licensees and Content partners reserve the right, at any time, to prosecute any violation of copyright or

      <h3>10. Content, Content Limitations and Downloads.</h3>
      <p>Content, including but not limited to video, audio, graphics, photos text, special features, software and
        messages may be streamed to you or otherwise made available to you in connection with your use of the Platform.
        Please note that some Content may specify an access window in which you will be able to view the Content. The
        access window may vary, you should pay close attention to the description provided with the Content. During the
        applicable access window, you will be able to view the Content as many times as you want, BUT ONCE THE ACCESS
        WINDOW FOR A PARTICULAR CONTENT ITEM TERMINATES, YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT PIECE OF
        CONTENT. It is your responsibility to monitor the access window for each piece of Content available via the
        Platform, and TIME and its partners and affiliates accept no liability for any access windows or the expiration
        thereof. TIME reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disable access to any Content at any time,
        regardless
        of the posted access windows or its programming schedules. Please note that not all Content will be available to
        all users across all compatible devices. Access to certain Content may depend upon your geographic location
        (i.e.,
        you will not be able to access Content from outside the Service Area), whether you are able to maintain an
        internet connection, or available bandwidth and equipment used to access the Platform. You should be sure to
        read
        the detailed description of each piece of Content to determine options for viewing or accessing that Content.
        While we do our best to keep the Content descriptions up-to-date, TIME does not warrant that such descriptions
        will always be complete, current, or accurate. No transfer of ownership to any portion of the Content shall be
        made as a result of any access you are granted to the Platform as a result of your Subscription or TIME Account.

        at any time.</p>
      <p>Certain Content on the Platform may be available for temporary download on certain supported devices, in order
        to
        enable offline viewing when you do not have a network connection ("Downloadable Content"). To download Content,
        make sure you have a network connection and sign into the Platform on your phone or tablet. Choose an episode or
        movie that you want to download and tap "Download". TIME may control, in its sole discretion, the amount of
        Downloadable Content permissible for each TIME Account (across all Authorized Users and devices), and the
        expiration rules for each piece of Downloadable Content. At the time of download, the Platform will provide you
        with information specifying the Content download limits and the expiration rules for each piece of Downloadable
        Content.</p>
      <p>TIME uses various technologies to provide you with an optimal viewing experience. That said, quality of
        Content,
        including resolution, may be affected by the format of the Content, your location, the speed and bandwidth of
        your
        internet service, and the devices used, among other factors. HD, Ultra HD and 4K Ultra HD availability, if and
        as
        applicable, for certain Content depends on your internet service and device capabilities. Not all Content is
        available in all formats. The time it takes you to begin playing Content will vary based on a number of factors,
        including your location, internet bandwidth, the number of devices simultaneously connecting to the same
        network,
        the Content you have selected, and the configuration of the device you are using. As a result, TIME is unable to
        make any warranties about the Content in these respects.</p>

      <p>Summary:</p>
      <p>For web posting, reprint, transcript for TIME material, please contact licensing@time.com</p>
      <p>Our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction.
        Please contact TIME at help.time.com. <b>In the unlikely event that you're not satisfied with customer service's
          solution (or if TIME has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so
          informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead
          of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b></p>
      <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge
        or
        jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless
        expressly limited by this Dispute Resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a
        court can award. <b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class
          arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed
        $75,000,
        we will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees
        from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>
      <p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you more than the amount of the
        arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the
        arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute.</p>
      <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
      <p><b>(1) Claims Subject to Arbitration:</b> TIME and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b>
        between
        us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of
        your
        or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and
        partners). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited
        to:
      </p>
      <p>• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract,
        tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</p>
      <p>• claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to
        advertising);</p>
      <p>• claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;</p>
      <p>• claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a
        certified class; and</p>
      <p>• claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>References to "TIME," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
        licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; our respective
        predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns (including Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and its subsidiaries
        and
        affiliates); and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior
        Agreements
        between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only
        individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of
        general jurisdiction. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
        federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
        <b>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
          to
          participate in a class action</b>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the
        Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision
        shall survive termination of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p><b>(2) Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes:</b> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the
        other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to TIME should be sent by certified mail to: General
        Counsel, WarnerMedia News & Sports, 1 TIME Center, Atlanta, GA 30303 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a)
        describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
      </p>
      <p>If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you
        or
        we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us
        or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to
        which
        you or us is entitled. You may download a form to initiate arbitration at:
        adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf.</p>
      <p><b>(3) Arbitration Procedure:</b> The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA
        Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be
        administered by the AAA. (If the AAA is unavailable, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the
        parties
        or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by
        requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that
        issues
        relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be
        brought
        in arbitration are for the court to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in
        other
        arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
        take
        place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you
        may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
        arbitrator,
        through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
        $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
        arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
        essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as provided in subsection (6) below, the
        arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law.</p>
      <p><a href="">(4) Arbitration Fees:</a> After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced
        arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater
        than $75,000 in value. (The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.
        If
        you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.)
        We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with
        the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
        relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
        forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA
        Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your
        obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief
        valued
        at greater than $75,000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
      </p>
      <p><b>(5) Alternative Payment and Attorney Premium:</b> If you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice
        requirements above in subsection (2) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the
        value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will:</p>
      <p>• pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and</p>
      <p>• pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert
        witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your
        claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").</p>
      <p>If we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your
        attorney
        will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator
        awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
        reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the
        proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. In
        assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last
        written
        settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or
        expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.</p>
      <p>The right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under
        applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does
        not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover both the attorney
        premium
        and a duplicative award of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws we may have a right to an award of
        attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award.</p>
      <p><b>(6) Requirement of Individual Arbitration:</b> The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
        only
        in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
        that party's individual claim. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE
        ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
        more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private
        attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on
        non-individualized
        declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation
        are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for
        relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or
        request for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>
      <p><b>(7) Future Changes to Arbitration Provision:</b> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
        contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the
        Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the
        arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
        arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
